0.1.8
=====
  - pdoc now interprets `__pdoc__[key] = None` as an explicit way
    to hide `key` from the public interface of its module.

0.1.7
=====
  - Removed __new__ from the public interface. I think __init__
    is sufficient.

0.1.6
=====
  - Fixed bug #1.

0.1.5
=====
  - Fixed a bug with an improper use of getattr.
  - Made pdoc aware of __slots__. (Every identifier in __slots__
    is automatically interpreted as an instance variable.)

0.1.4
=====
  - Fixed bug where getargspec wasn't being used in Python 2.x.

0.1.3
=====
  - Avoid a FQDN lookup.

0.1.2
=====
  - A few doco touchups.
  - Fixed a bug in Py3K. Use getfullargspec when available.

0.1.1
=====
  - Documentation touch ups.
  - Removed unused command line flags.

0.1.0
=====
First public release.
