   ([#624](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/pull/624), @JCGoran)
 - If a variable's value meets certain entropy criteria and matches an environment variable value,
   pdoc will now emit a warning and display the variable's name as a placeholder instead.
   This heuristic is meant to prevent accidental leakage of environment secrets and can be disabled by setting
   `PDOC_DISPLAY_ENV_VARS=1`.

## 2023-02-19: pdoc 13.0.0

 - pdoc now skips constructors if they neither have a docstring nor any parameters. This improves display
   of classes that are not meant to be instantiated manually, for example when using PyO3.
   ([#510](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/pull/510), @mhils)
 - Automatically fold a variable's default value if it exceeds 100 characters.

 - Fix a CSS issue where the lower half of the navigation toggle would be unresponsive on mobile.
   ([#510](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/pull/510), @mhils)

## 2023-01-06: pdoc 12.3.1

   ([#450](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/450), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))

## 2022-09-20: pdoc 12.2.0

 - Make documentation of variables more consistent. Variables with a default value
   and no docstring are now hidden, matching the behavior of variables with a type annotation only.
   ([#411](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/411), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - Remove `format` argument from `pdoc.pdoc()`. For the forseeable future, pdoc will only support HTML export.

   ([#411](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/411), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - Do not execute or document `__main__.py` files. `__main__` submodules can still be documented
   by explicitly passing them when invoking pdoc.
   ([#438](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/438), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))

## 2022-06-08: pdoc 12.1.0

   ([#428](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/428), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - pdoc now terminates if a module cannot be imported instead of raising a warning.
   You may need to preemptively
   [exclude submodules](https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc.html#exclude-submodules-from-being-documented)
   that fail to import anyway.
   ([#407](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/407), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))

 - Fix linking of some function return annotations.
 - Refine rendering of function signatures. Syntax errors are now handled more gracefully.
 - Gracefully handle the case when users specify objects instead of strings in `__all__`.

## 2022-05-15: pdoc 12.0.0

 - Improve rendering of function signatures. Annotations are now syntax-highlighted! ✨
 - Change the implementation of *View Source* to not use an HTML `<details>` element. Recent versions
   of Chrome started to auto-expand source code blocks on search, which made it difficult to search in docstrings.
 - Line numbers now start at 1, not at 0.
 - The aforementioned template improvements may require minor adjustments to custom templates. 
   Users who do not use custom templates are unaffected.
   - Users who customized the `view_source` macro: 
     This macro has been split into three smaller macros, please check 
     [`module.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/default/module.html.jinja2).
     This change was necessary to make sure that the button does not overflow function signatures.
   - Users who customized the `member`, `class`, `function`, `submodule` or `variable` macros:
     Common parts have been combined in the `member` macro, please check 
     [`module.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/default/module.html.jinja2).
 - Fix: Hide the nav menu checkbox in Firefox.  

## 2022-05-04: pdoc 11.2.0

 - pdoc now picks up type annotations from `.pyi` stub files (PEP-561).
   This greatly improves support for native modules where no Python source code is available,
   for example when using PyO3.
   ([#390](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/390), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - Template Style Improvements: The size of headings within docstrings has been reduced.
   Docstrings are now slightly indented on wide screens.
   ([#383](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/383), [@jacksund](https://github.com/jacksund) and [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - Improve rendering of `typing.TypedDict` subclasses.
   ([#389](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/389), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))

## 2022-04-24: pdoc 11.1.0

 - Display line numbers when viewing source code.
   ([#328](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/328), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - Fix catastrophic backtracking in a markdown2 regex that processes pyshell examples.
   ([#376](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/376), [@Andrew-Sheridan](https://github.com/Andrew-Sheridan) and [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - pdoc now uses the submodule name in the rendered sidebar, rather than the full import path. 
   ([#374](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/374), [@jacksund](https://github.com/jacksund))
 - Fix a bug where explicit links were rendered incorrectly.
   ([#382](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/382), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - Fix compatibility with Pygments 2.12.
   ([#384](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/384), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))

## 2022-04-06: pdoc 11.0.0

 - pdoc now picks up reStructuredText syntax in docstrings by default. We still prefer plain Markdown, 
   but this change makes it possible to seamlessly include directives like `.. include:: README.md` or admonitions, 
   which have no Markdown equivalent. reStructuredText processing can be disabled by explicitly setting the docstring 
   format to Markdown.
   ([#373](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/373), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - pdoc's documentation has been revised, it now also includes [a simple recipe for using pdoc with GitHub Pages
   ](https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc.html#deploying-to-github-pages). 
   ([#373](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/373), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - Improve display of reStructuredText admonitions.
   ([#372](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/372), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))
 - Add support for reStructuredText field lists: `:param foo: text`.
   ([#275](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/275), [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils))

## 2022-03-23: pdoc 10.0.4

 - Include `typing.TypeVar` variables in documentation if they have an explicit docstring.
   ([#361](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/361), [@ktbarrett](https://github.com/ktbarrett))
 - Make sure that new-style type aliases like `dict[str,str]` are rendered like their old-style 
   `typing.Dict[str,str]` equivalents.
   ([#363](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/363), [@hriebl](https://github.com/hriebl))
 - Fix a bug in markdown2 where code snippets interfere with latex expressions
   ([#340](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/340), [@Crozzers](https://github.com/Crozzers))

## 2022-03-08: pdoc 10.0.3

 - Fix linking of modules.
   ([#360](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/360), [@vlad-nn](https://github.com/vlad-nn))

## 2022-03-01: pdoc 10.0.2

 - When determining the docstring for a constructor, prefer `Class.__init__.__doc__` over `Metaclass.__call__.__doc__`
   over `Class.__new__.__doc__`.
   ([#352](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/352), [@denised](https://github.com/denised))
 - Improve linking of classes that are re-exported in a common top-level namespace.
 - Make it more clear that Markdown ist the default docformat. ([@Dliwk](https://github.com/Dliwk))
 - Fix compatiblity with code using `ctypes.util.find_library`.
   ([#358](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/358), [@bubalis](https://github.com/bubalis))

## 2022-02-14: pdoc 10.0.1

 - Fix a bug where pdoc would crash after executing `TYPE_CHECKING` blocks.
   ([#351](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/351), [@Dliwk](https://github.com/Dliwk))
 - Add ability to specify custom CSS rules in `custom.css`.
   The migration instructions in the 10.0.0 changelog entry have been updated accordingly.

## 2022-02-14: pdoc 10.0.0

 - Template improvements may require minor adjustments to custom templates. Users who do not use custom templates are
   unaffected. ([#346](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/346))
   - Users who embed pdoc's output into other systems: The main layout (sidebar/content) is now part of
     [`frame.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/default/frame.html.jinja2)
     instead of
     [`module.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/default/module.html.jinja2).
     This allows
     [`index.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/default/index.html.jinja2)
     to cleanly extend `frame.html.jinja2` instead of patching `module.html.jinja2`. See
     [`examples/mkdocs`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/tree/main/examples/mkdocs) for an updated example.
     If you defined a custom `{% block nav %}` block, you need to remove the outermost `<nav>` element, which is 
     now part of the frame around it.
   - Users who customized pdoc's CSS: CSS style definitions moved from `module.html.jinja2` into individual CSS files,
     namely
     [`theme.css`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/theme.css),
     [`layout.css`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/layout.css), and
     [`content.css`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/content.css).
     You can now either provide replacements for these files, or
     [specify additional CSS rules in `custom.css`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/examples/custom-template/).
     The existing Jinja2 blocks `style_pdoc`, `style_theme`, `style_layout`, `style_content` are being deprecated, see
     [`frame.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/default/frame.html.jinja2)
     for details.
   - Users who customized `syntax-highlighting.css`: pdoc now consistently uses `.pdoc-code` instead of `.pdoc`
     or `.codehilite` for syntax highlighting. `.codehilite` is being deprecated but will continue to work, giving
     custom templates time to migrate.
 - A new `--favicon` option can be used to specify a favicon. The existing embedded default favicon has been removed
   to reduce page size. ([#345](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/345))
 - Submodules that are mentioned in `__all__` are not listed as part of the module contents anymore. Instead, they
   are listed in the navigation. This now matches the behavior as if `__all__` were not specified.
   If this affects you, please leave feedback in [#341](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/341).
   The old behavior can be temporarily restored by setting `PDOC_SUBMODULES=1` as an environment variable while we
   gather feedback.
 - In line with the above change, [`pdoc.doc.Module.members`](https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc/doc.html#Namespace.members)
   does not contain submodules anymore unless `PDOC_SUBMODULES=1` is set. API users are advised to use
   [`pdoc.doc.Module.submodules`](https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc/doc.html#Module.submodules).
 - Add a better warning message if users use `X | Y`-style type annotations
   ([PEP 604](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/)) on older Python versions which do not support them.
 - Always defuse insecure `repr()` calls to also cover customized templates.
 - Improve overly greedy linking of identifiers ([#342](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/342))
 - Include `py.typed` file in wheel distributions.

## 2022-01-26: pdoc 9.0.1

 - Emit a deprecation warning if custom templates attempt to include assets that were removed from or moved within pdoc.
 - Improve representation of default values.
 - On mobile devices, scroll the menu into view
   when the hamburger menu button is clicked.
 - On mobile devices, restrict the width of the search bar
   to avoid overflowing into the menu button.

## 2022-01-24: pdoc 9.0.0

 - **Breaking:** For projects that only document a single module (and its submodules),
   the module index has been removed. `index.html` now redirects to the top-level module instead.
   Direct submodules continue to be accessible in the menu.
   See [#318](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/issues/318) for details.
 - Moved template assets (SVG, CSS, JS) into a `resources/` subdirectory in the template folder.  
   Custom templates may need to adjust their paths if they reference these files.
 - pdoc web server now picks a random port if 8080 is unavailable and no explicit port has been passed.
 - Improve search tokenization to better match
   on function arguments.
 - The "Edit on GitHub" button now says "Edit on GitLab" if it points to
   GitLab, or "Edit Source" if neither platform is used.
 - The `all_modules` variable now allows templates to access all other module objects.
 - Add `pdoc.doc.Module.from_name` to simplify module creation.
 - Do not linkify identifiers that are already manually linked.
 - Hide modules in the submodule list if the were explicitly excluded from documentation.
 - When importing local file paths, always make sure that the directory is
   at the front of `sys.path`.
 - Improve evaluation of type annotations.

## 2022-01-14: pdoc 8.3.0

 - The search functionality now also covers function parameters,
   annotated types, default values, and base classes.
 - Work around a Blink renderer bug to make sure that arguments
   are clickable and the small "expand" triangle is displayed
   next to the *View Source* button.
 - Add negated module specs to exclude specific (sub)modules.
   For example, `pdoc foo !foo.bar` documents `foo` and all submodules of `foo` except `foo.bar`.
 - Only display headings up to a depth of 2 in the table of contents for module docstrings.

## 2022-01-05: pdoc 8.2.0

 - Improve rendering of warnings emitted by pdoc.
 - Improve search quality by disabling the word stemmer.

## 2021-12-28: pdoc 8.1.0

 - Add CSS styling for Markdown tables. (@sitic)
 - Prefer epydoc-style docstrings after variable assignments 
   over the variable's `__doc__`.

 - Improve error messages for invalid type hints.
 - Fix module index when using pdoc's web server.

## 2021-09-19: pdoc 8.0.0

   only fetched on demand, which improves page size and performance.
 - pdoc's search now works from `file://` pages.
 - Improve display of (extension module) data descriptors.

## 2021-08-18: pdoc 7.4.0

 - Display error webpage for template errors.
 - When processing type hints, detect imports in 
   [`TYPE_CHECKING`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TYPE_CHECKING) 
   blocks.
 - Add `--no-search` to disable search functionality.

## 2021-08-09: pdoc 7.3.1

 - Fix a bug where an empty footer was incorrectly emitted by the template.

## 2021-08-09: pdoc 7.3.0

 - Full compatibility with Python 3.10.
 - Many template customizations are now directly available as command line switches, for example:
    - `--math`
    - `--logo`
    - `--no-show-source`
    - `--footer-text`

## 2021-07-28: pdoc 7.2.0

 - Don't include variables/attributes that only have a type annotation but no value and no docstring.

## 2021-06-03: pdoc 7.1.0

 - Invoking `pdoc` without any arguments now asks the user to specify module name
   instead of starting pdoc with all available modules. The previous implementation 
   had a poor user experience as building the search index took too long.
 - Improve documentation of `pdoc.extract`. `pdoc.extract.parse_specs` has been renamed to `walk_specs`, 
   the old API now emits a deprecation warning.
 - Add `pdoc.doc.Doc.source_lines` to access where in a file an object is defined.
 - Fix a crash when importing `asyncio` on Windows on Python 3.7. 

## 2021-05-30: pdoc 7.0.3

 - Do not show a search bar on the module page if only one module is documented.
   If the entire documentation is contained on a single HTML page, the browser's search functionality is just as good.
   Users can piggyback on their preexisting knowledge about the search semantics in this case.

   already loaded by pdoc.
 - If a class is publicly reimported in the current module, pdoc now links to
   the reimported instance instead of the source location.

## 2021-03-19: pdoc 6.4.1

 - Private function decorators (those starting with "\_")
   are now hidden by default. (@zmoon)
 - If pdoc is invoked with a name that is both an installed Python module 
   and a local directory, notify the user that the installed module will be documented.
 - `__doc__` is now not rendered as a variable, even if included in `__all__`.
 - Submodules are now internally assigned a qualname, which fixes broken anchor links.

## 2021-03-10: pdoc 6.4.0

 - Functions in the current scope can now be referenced without specifying
   the full qualified name. For example, one can use `bar()` instead of 
   `Foo.bar()` in the docstring of `Foo`.

 - Bugfix: pdoc now retains custom rendering configuration when it renders itself with live-reload.

## 2021-02-05 pdoc 5.0.0

 - Make it easier to embed pdoc into other systems:
   See <https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc.html#integrate-pdoc-into-other-systems> for details.
   This change may be a minor breaking change for users using custom templates.
 - Generic class bases are now displayed fully. 
   This may be a minor breaking change for users who customized class base output.
 - Add header anchors to documentation items.

 - Live-reloading is now more robust.
 - Improvements to the default theme.

## 2021-01-22: pdoc 2.0.0

## 2021-01-19: pdoc 1.0.0

This release features a major rewrite of pdoc, dropping compatibility
with Python 2 and focusing on modern Python 3 only.

 - Added: First-class support for type annotations
 - Added: Simpler directory structure
 - Added: New responsive documentation theme
 - Added: New website and documentation
 - Added: 100% test coverage and CI
 - Use Jinja2 instead of mako.
 - Removed: Support for `__pdoc__`, which is rarely required
   when following modern Python standards. This feature may return
   depending on user feedback.
 - Removed: Markdown output. The project now focuses on HTML documentation.
   PRs to re-add markdown support will be gladly accepted.

pdoc is now maintained by [@mhils](https://github.com/mhils) and the rest of the mitmproxy team.


## pdoc 0.3.2

  - Bugfix release.


## pdoc 0.3.1

  - Source code is extracted from __wrapped__ if it exists, and then
    falls back to inspect.getsourcelines. This reverses the behavior
    implemented in #6.
  - Fix Python 2.6 compatibility by requiring Markdown < 2.5 (#19).
    Markdown 2.5 dropped support for Python 2.6.
  - Get rid of tabs that sneaked in from #17.
  - Fix pep8 violations.

## pdoc 0.3.0

  - Major HTML face lift. Kudos to @knadh!
    (PR: https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/pull/17)

## pdoc 0.2.4

  - Fixed bug in HTTP server that was referencing a non-existent
    variable.

## pdoc 0.2.3

  - Fixed #10 (the --template-dir flag now works).

## pdoc 0.2.2

  - Fixes #7 by ignoring module loaders that lack a 'path' attribute.

## pdoc 0.2.1

  - Fixes #5 by trying to find source for decorated functions.
    (@austin1howard)

## pdoc 0.2.0

  - Fix issue #2 by making pdoc a package instead of a module.
    The templates are now included as package_data, which seems
    to be more portable (its final location is more predictable).

## pdoc 0.1.8

  - pdoc now interprets `__pdoc__[key] = None` as an explicit way
    to hide `key` from the public interface of its module.

## pdoc 0.1.7

  - Removed __new__ from the public interface. I think __init__
    is sufficient.

## pdoc 0.1.6

  - Fixed bug #1.

## pdoc 0.1.5

  - Fixed a bug with an improper use of getattr.
  - Made pdoc aware of __slots__. (Every identifier in __slots__
    is automatically interpreted as an instance variable.)

## pdoc 0.1.4

  - Fixed bug where getargspec wasn't being used in Python 2.x.

## pdoc 0.1.3

  - Avoid a FQDN lookup.

## pdoc 0.1.2

  - A few doco touchups.
  - Fixed a bug in Py3K. Use getfullargspec when available.

## pdoc 0.1.1

  - Documentation touch ups.
  - Removed unused command line flags.

## pdoc 0.1.0

First public release.
