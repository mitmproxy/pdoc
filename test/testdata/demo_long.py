# Test Module

This is a test module demonstrating pdoc's parsing capabilities.

- All docstrings support plain markdown.
- Including code!

  ```python
  print("hello world")
  ```
- You can link to classes or modules by putting them between backticks: `demo.Dog.bark`
  - The only requirement is that you must specify the full qualified path for external modules.
- Module members appear in the order they are listed in the source code.
  If you do not like the order in pdoc, you should probably have a different order in your source file as well.

# A Second Section

You can have multiple sections in your module docstring,
which will also show up in the navigation.
