`pdoc` is a library and a command line program to discover the public 
interface of a Python module or package. The `pdoc` script can be used to 
generate plain text or HTML of a module's public interface, or it can be used 
to run an HTTP server that serves generated HTML for installed modules.
It is intended that `pdoc` will be a replacement for the unmaintained
[epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net).

To see what generated documentation looks like, check out the
[documentation for pdoc](http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/pdoc).

Prominent features include:

* Support for documenting data representation by traversing the abstract syntax 
  to find docstrings for module, class and instance variables.
* For cases where docstrings aren't appropriate (like a
  [namedtuple](http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/collections.html#namedtuple-factory-function-for-tuples-with-named-fields)),
  the special variable `__pdoc__` can be used in your module to
  document any identifier in your public interface.
* Usage is simple. Just write all your docstring documentation as Markdown
  (default), or reStructuredText. There are no added special syntax rules.
* `pdoc` respects your `__all__` variable when present.
* `pdoc` will automatically link identifiers in your docstrings to its
  corresponding documentation.
* When `pdoc` is run as an HTTP server, external linking is supported between 
  packages.
* The `pdoc` HTTP server will cache generated documentation and automatically
  regenerate it if the source code has been updated.
* When available, source code for modules, functions and classes can be viewed 
  in the HTML documentation.
* Inheritance is used when possible to infer docstrings for class members.

The above features are explained in more detail in pdoc's documentation.

`pdoc` has been tested on Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3.


Installation
------------
`pdoc` is [on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdoc) and is installable via 
`pip`:

    pip install pdoc

Dependencies are [mako](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Mako) and
[markdown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown). (If you're using Python
2.6, then you'll also need [argparse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse).)

[Pygments](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pygments) is an optional dependency. 
When it's installed, source code will have syntax highlighting.


Documentation
-------------
Documentation for the `pdoc` library is available from `pdoc` itself:
[pdoc.burntsushi.net/pdoc](http://pdoc.burntsushi.net/pdoc). The documentation 
includes a more in depth description of the features listed above.


Example usage
-------------
`pdoc` will accept a Python module file, package directory or an import path.
For example, to view the documentation for the `csv` module in the console:

    pdoc csv

Or, you could view it by pointing at the file directly:

    pdoc /usr/lib/python2.7/csv.py

Submodules are fine too:

    pdoc multiprocessing.pool

You can also filter the documentation with a keyword:

    pdoc csv reader

Generate HTML with the `--html` switch:

    pdoc --html csv

A file called `csv.m.html` will be written to the current directory.

Or start an HTTP server that shows documentation for any installed module:

    pdoc --http

Then open your web browser to `http://localhost:8080`.

There are many other options to explore. You can see them all by running:

    pdoc --help


Virtualenv
----------

`pdoc` works well with `virtualenv`. If you are documenting a project that is
installed within a `virtualenv` environment, you should be able to install `pdoc`
directly into that environment and use it with no further configuration.


Submodule loading
-----------------

`pdoc` uses idiomatic Python when loading your modules. Therefore, for `pdoc`
to find any submodules of the input module you specify on the command line,
those modules must be available through Python's ordinary module loading process.

This is not a problem for globally installed modules like `sys`, but can be
a problem for your own sub-modules depending on how you have installed them.

To ensure that `pdoc` can load any submodules imported by the modules you
are generating documentation for, you should add the appropriate directories
to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

For example, if a local module `a.py` imports `b.py` that is installed as
`/home/jsmith/pylib/b.py`, then you should make sure that your `PYTHONPATH`
includes `/home/jsmith/pylib`. 

If `pdoc` cannot load any modules imported by the input module, it will exit
with an error message indicating which module could not be loaded.

Motivation
----------
At the time of writing, there are three tools I know of that provide automatic
documentation for my Python packages. Those tools are
[pydoc](http://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html),
[epydoc](http://epydoc.sourceforge.net) and
[sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org). `pydoc` does not provide facilities for 
documenting data representation and its HTML output is impossible for me to use 
productively. `sphinx` is a tool I have been unable to get working despite
trying and failing several times over the past couple years. Moreover, 
automatic API documentation does not seem to be a primary goal of `sphinx`,
where prose separate from the source code seems encouraged. If the 
documentation for my module is not with my source code, then I have no hope of 
maintaining it.

Finally, `epydoc` is what I had been using for several years. The last release 
was in 2008 and it is not compatible with Python 3. In addition to the web
pages it produces being difficult for me to browse, `epydoc` is over 10,000 
lines of code (not including comments or HTML generation). By the same measure,
`pdoc` is under 800 lines of code.
