"""
pdoc has a search box which allows users to quickly find relevant parts in the documentation.
This feature is implemented entirely client-side so that pdoc can still be hosted statically,
and works without any third-party services in a privacy-preserving way. When a user focuses the
search box for the first time, pdoc will fetch the search index (`search.js`) and use that to
answer all upcoming queries.

##### Single-Page Documentation

If pdoc is documenting a single module only, search functionality will be disabled.
The browser's built-in search functionality will provide a better user experience in these cases.

##### Search Coverage

The search functionality covers all documented elements and their docstrings.
You may find documentation objects using their name, arguments, or type annotations; the source code is not considered.

##### Search Performance

pdoc uses [Elasticlunr.js](https://github.com/weixsong/elasticlunr.js) to implement search. To improve end user
performance, pdoc will attempt to precompile the search index when building the documentation. This only works if
`nodejs` is available, and pdoc gracefully falls back to client-side index building if this is not the case.

If your search index reaches a size where compilation times are meaningful and `nodejs` cannot be invoked,
pdoc will let you know and print a notice when building your documentation. In this case it should be enough to install
a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your system and make a `nodejs` or `node` available on your PATH.
There are no other additional dependencies. pdoc only uses `node` to interpret a local JS file, it does not download any
additional packages.

You can test if your search index is precompiled by clicking the search box (so that the search index is fetched) and
then checking your browser's developer console.

##### Search Index Size

The search index can be relatively large as it includes all docstrings. For larger projects, you should make sure that
you have [HTTP compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_compression) and caching enabled. `search.js` usually
compresses to about 10% of its original size. For example, pdoc's own precompiled search index compresses from 312kB
to 27kB.

##### Disabling Search

If you wish to disable the search functionality, you can pass `--no-search` when invoking pdoc.
