# What is pdoc?

pdoc auto-generates API documentation that follows your project's Python module hierarchy.
It can be used as a command-line application as well as a library.

*pdoc the command-line application* can be used to render a project's
documentation as static HTML files. It also includes a live-reloading
web server to preview changes.

*pdoc the library* provides types and functions for accessing the public
documentation of a Python module. This includes modules, functions,
classes and variables.

# How does pdoc work?

In a nutshell, pdoc takes a Python module name as input, imports it, creates a `pdoc.doc.Module` object
that extracts all docstrings, and passes it to the HTML template for rendering.

This implies a few things:

 - Your documentation lives right by your code, not in extra files.
 - The structure of the generated documentation matches that of your Python package:
   There is a direct mapping from say `mypackage/helpers.py` to `mypackage/helpers.html`.
   As such, pdoc works best with small projects and projects that have a well-defined hierarchy.
 - You can customize the output by changing the template.

# Example: `shelter.py`

For this example, we have some code to keep track of the dogs in our local animal shelter.
Here's our current code:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.friends = []

    def bark(self, loud: bool = True):
        ...
```

First, we add docstrings and type annotations to explain what we are doing.

```python
"""
This module deals with all animals. So far, only dogs are implemented.

# TODO

 - Add the rest of the animals.

"""

class Dog:
    name: str
    """The name of this dog. May contain non-ASCII characters."""
    friends: list["Dog"]
    """Friends this dog has made."""

    def __init__(self, name: str):
        """Make a Dog without any friends (yet)."""
        self.name = name
        self.friends = []

    def bark(self, loud: bool = True):
        """*woof*"""

```

The docstrings we've added aren't pdoc-specific, we just use modern Python 3 conventions.
pdoc will later take your module, class, function and variable docstrings and render them
into a standalone documentation document.

Additionally, all docstrings are interpreted as Markdown by pdoc.
For example, the todo list in the example will be rendered with bullet points in your documentation.


### Invoking pdoc

Let's run pdoc on this module to see what we get:

```shell
pdoc ./shelter.py
```

This opens a browser with our module documentation. If we edit `shelter.py` now,
the page will reload automatically. Once we are happy with our changes, we can export our documentation
to HTML files:

```shell
pdoc -o ./docs ./shelter.py
```

This will create an HTML file at `docs/shelter.html` which contains our module documentation.

### Editing pdoc's HTML template

Next up, we want to insert the logo of our shelter in the navigation bar.
To do this, we need to edit pdoc's
[default HTML template](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/pdoc/templates/default/module.html.jinja2),
which uses the
[Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) templating language.
Inspecting the default template, we see that it defines an empty `nav_title` block right at the place where we want to insert our logo.
We can extend the default template by creating a file titled `module.html.jinja2` in the current directory
 with the following contents:

```html+jinja
{% extends "default/module.html.jinja2" %}
{% block nav_title %}
<img src="https://placedog.net/200?random" style="display: block; margin: 1em auto">
{% endblock %}
```

We then specify a custom template directory when invoking pdoc...

```shell
pdoc -t . ./shelter.py
```

...and the updated documentation â€“ with logo â€“ renders! ðŸŽ‰

pdoc's Jinja2 macros are defined using `{% defaultmacro %}`, which makes it possible to override them in a custom
template using a regular `{% macro %}` statement.
The default implementation of each macro is also available as `default_$macroname`.
See [`test/customtemplate/module.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/test/customtemplate/module.html.jinja2)
for more examples!

# How can I ... ?

## ...add documentation?

In Python, objects like modules, functions and classes have
a special attribute named `__doc__` which contains that object's
*docstring*.  The docstring comes from a special placement of a string
in your source code.  For example, the following code shows how to
define a function with a docstring and access the contents of that
docstring:

```python
>>> def test():
...     """This is a docstring."""
...     pass
...
>>> test.__doc__
'This is a docstring.'
```

Something similar can be done for classes and modules too. For classes,
the docstring should come on the line immediately following `class
...`. For modules, the docstring should start on the first line of
the file. These docstrings are what you see for each module, class,
function and method listed in the documentation produced by pdoc.

## ...document variables?

Python itself [does not attach docstrings to
variables](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0224). For example:

```python
variable = "SomeValue"
"""Docstring for variable."""
```

The resulting `variable` will have no `__doc__` attribute.
To compensate, pdoc will read the abstract syntax tree (an abstract representation of the source code)
and include all assignment statements immediately followed by a docstring.

Something similar is done for instance variables as well, which are either type-annotated in the class
or defined in a class's `__init__`. Here is an example showing both conventions detected by pdoc:

```python
class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    name: str
    """Full Name"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.weight: int = 10
        """Weight in kilograms"""
```


If you would like to distinguish an instance variable from a class variable,
you should use [`typing.ClassVar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.ClassVar):

```python
class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    breed_coode: ClassVar[str] = "GOLD"
    """International breed code (same for all instances)"""
    name: str
    """Full Name (different for each instance)"""
```

## ...control what is documented?

The public interface of a module is determined through one of two
ways.

- If `__all__` is defined in the module, then all identifiers in that list will be considered public.
   No other identifiers will be considered as public.
- If `__all__` is not defined, then pdoc will consider all members public that
   1. do not start with an underscore
   2. and are defined in the current module (i.e. they are not imported).

In general, we recommend to keep these conventions:

- If you want to document a private member, consider making it public.
- If you want to hide a public member, consider making it private.
- If you want to document a special `__dunder__` method, the recommended way to do so is
  to not document the dunder method specifically, but add some usage examples in the class documentation.

As a last resort, you can override pdoc's behavior with a custom module template (see
[*Editing pdoc's HTML template*](#editing-pdocs-html-template)).
You can find an example at
[`test/customtemplate/module.html.jinja2`](https://github.com/mitmproxy/pdoc/blob/main/test/customtemplate/module.html.jinja2).

## ...link to other identifiers?

In your documentation, you can link to other identifiers by enclosing them in backticks:
<code>\`pdoc\`</code> will link to `pdoc`.
When linking to identifiers in other modules, the identifier name must be fully qualified.
For example, <code>\`pdoc.doc.Doc\`</code> will be automatically linked to `pdoc.doc.Doc`,
while <code>\`Doc\`</code> only works within the `pdoc.doc` module.

pdoc will link all identifiers that are rendered in the current run.
This means that you need to run `pdoc module_a module_b` to have interlinking between module_a and module_b.
If you run `pdoc module_a` followed by `pdoc module_b`, there will be no cross-linking between the two modules.

## ...change the item order?

By default, documentation items are sorted in order of (first) appearance in the source code.
This means that if you want to move a particular function to the beginning of your documentation,
you need to move it there in your source code. This is not only useful to the readers of your documentation
but also useful to the consumers of your source code.

## ...use numpydoc or Google docstrings?

While pdoc prefers docstrings that are plain Markdown,
it also understands numpydoc and Google-style docstrings,
including a limited subset of reStructuredText (as used by Sphinx).
If your documentation follows one of these styles, you can:

1. Run `pdoc --docformat ...` to enable a particular docstring flavor globally, or
2. Add `__docformat__ = "google"` at the top-level of the module you are documenting.

pdoc does not implement the full reStructuredText specification and does not plan on doing so.
If you feel that it doesn't parse a docstring element properly, please amend
`pdoc.docstrings` and send us a pull request!

## ...integrate pdoc into other systems?

pdoc's HTML and CSS are written in a way that the default template can be easily adjusted
to produce standalone HTML fragments that can be embedded in other systems.
This makes it possible to integrate pdoc with almost every CMS or static site generator.
The only limitation at the moment is that you need to retain pdoc's directory structure
so that links between modules remain valid.

First, [create a custom `frame.html.jinja2` template](#editing-pdocs-html-template) to only emit CSS and HTML body contents:
```html+jinja
{% block style %}{% endblock %}
{% block body %}{% endblock %}
```

Second, create a custom `module.html.jinja2` to suppress the layout CSS
and navigation:
```html+jinja
{% extends "default/module.html.jinja2" %}
{% block nav %}{% endblock %}
{% block style_layout %}{% endblock %}
```

This should be enough to produce HTML files that can be embedded into other pages.
All CSS selectors are prefixed with `.pdoc` so that pdoc's page style does not interfere with the rest of your website.

# Docstring Inheritance

pdoc extends the standard use of docstrings in two important ways:
by introducing variable docstrings (see [*How can I document variables?*](#document-variables)),
and by allowing functions and classes to inherit docstrings and type annotations.

This is useful to not unnecessairly repeat information. Consider this example:

```python
class Dog:
    def bark(self, loud: bool = True) -> None:
        """
        Make the dog bark. If `loud` is True,
        use full volume. Not supported by all breeds.
        """

class GoldenRetriever(Dog):
    def bark(self, loud):
        print("Woof Woof")
```

In Python, the docstring for `GoldenRetriever.bark` is empty, even though one was
defined in `Dog.bark`. If pdoc generates documentation for the above
code, then it will automatically attach the docstring for `Dog.bark` to
`GoldenRetriever.bark` if it does not have a docstring.

# Limitations

**Markdown and PDF Output**

pdoc currently only supports HTML as an output format.
We would be happy to accept contributions for Markdown and PDF.
